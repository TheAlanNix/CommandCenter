# Cisco Command Center

Cisco Command Center is a project to collect and correlate event data across multiple Cisco Security (and possibly third-party) products, and display that data in an easy to understand interface.  The end goal is to allow Security Analysts to easily identify attacks and the offending hosts, and perform remediations against those attacks - all from a single web application.
